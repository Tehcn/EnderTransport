## Installation

> This installation process assumes you have never installed a Minecraft mod before. Depending on your system, you may or may not have to follow all of these steps

1. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use) (note that you should close the Minecraft Launcher during this step).
2. Download the version of the mod that fits your Minecraft version into the `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods` folder (if it doesn't exist, create it).
3. Open the Minecraft Launcher, and launch the newly created Fabric profile.

## Features

### Manufacturing

#### Steel

Steel is a crucial resource in Ender Transport. It's required for every transportation option offered by the mod. Luckily, crafting steel is a simple process. All you need is iron, coal, and lava. You put these items into an alloy furnace, and you get steel.

### Transport

Transport is the reason you downloaded this mod, so let's go over your options.

#### Steel Minecart

The most rudimentary choice is the steel minecart. Its recipe is nearly identical to a normal minecart's, except that it uses steel. However, it travels at twice the speed of a normal minecart, clocking in at 16 blocks/second.
